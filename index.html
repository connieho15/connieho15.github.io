								<h3>Split My Trip</h3>
								<p>This website was built at UBC Local Hack Day Hackathon. In a team of 4, we managed to do this in 12 hours. The aim of this website is to track and organize travel expenses. The user can input their expenses including who paid and who was involved in the transaction. Then the app will calculate how much each person owes the other, while minimizing the number of transactions using a graph-based algorithm. Given more time, we would have liked to implement social media linked accounts and multi-currency support. </p>

								<h3>CPSC 210: Meetup</h3>
								<p>This was my first project in my CPSC career. This mobile app allows users to input their class schedules. After that, the app will find a time for the user and their "friend" to meet (assuming this "friend" has this app as well, but that part was simulated). The app will then find a common time and location that the two can meet, using Google Maps and Foursquare API for locations and routes. For bonus, I also added reviews and cuisine choice from the API. </p>

                                <p>I recently attended a free iOS Development Workshop hosted by Lighthouse Labs. I was introduced to XCode and the basics of Storyboarding a mobile application and the structure of what an app would look like. Although there wasn't a lot of coding involved, I managed to create this simple prototype music player application. I love that XCode has "Views" with UI controls that can be easily added and look forward to learning more about iOS Applications! </p>

                                <p>During my work term at Datrend Systems, I developed the vPad-IDE, an IDE written entirely in C# that is configured for custom VPL and RFA languages developed by the company to be used on vPad Android Tablets by Biomedical Maintenance teams in hospitals. The IDE allows non-technical staff to be able to write scripts and instructions to be executed on tablets with features like auto-completion and syntax highlighting, while customizing their maintenance systems for different equipment and regulations. Extra features include Android Emulation, PDF/Word Export and Bluetooth Export. </p>

                                <p>This application is what I started at Deloitte in Hong Kong! This app is supposed to be used for travel management systems. As with a lot of enterprise-level apps, there’s a sense of “User Profile” and “Client” Search function. These features were HTTP calls to the company API. The cool thing is that these apps are written entirely with Javascript and HTML so it is easy for a web developer to develop a multi-platform application for iOS, Windows Phone AND Android! This is available to anyone with a Student/Community/Enterprise version of Visual Studio and is completely free! Download Visual Studio and give it a try yourself. </p>

								<h3>CPSC 310: Cultural Compass</h3>
								<p>This is a website that allows a user to search for Cultural Spaces by keyboard and display them on an interactive map where you can move your own user location and pinpoint a route that can be travelled to the cultural space. In addition, we implemented user storage and incorporated APIs from both Google Maps and Facebook. I learned a lot about group programming through github and skills such as demo-ing and testing. This was done in a team of 4.  Enjoy!</p>

I am also proficient with Cantonese and Mandarin, two of the fastest growing languages in Vancouver. </p>
