								<h3>CPSC 310: Cultural Compass</h3>
								<p>This is a website that allows a user to search for Cultural Spaces by keyboard and display them on an interactive map where you can move your own user location and pinpoint a route that can be travelled to the cultural space. In addition, we implemented user storage and incorporated APIs from both Google Maps and Facebook. I learned a lot about group programming through github and skills such as demo-ing and testing. This was done in a team of 4.  Enjoy!</p>

								<h3>Deloitte Cordova Application</h3>
								<p>This application is what I started at Deloitte in Hong Kong! This app is supposed to be used for travel management. As with a lot of enterprise-level apps, there’s a sense of “User Profile” and “Client” Search function. These features were HTTP calls to the company API. The cool thing is that these apps are written entirely with Javascript and HTML so it is easy for a web developer to develop a multi-platform application for iOS, Windows Phone AND Android!</p>

								<h3>Datrend vPad IDE</h3>
								<p>During my work term at Datrend Systems, I developed the vPad Integrated Development Environment, an IDE written entirely in C# that is configured for custom VPL and RFA languages developed by the company to be used on vPad Android Tablets by Biomedical Maintenance teams in hospitals. The IDE allows non-technical staff to be able to write scripts and instructions to be executed on tablets with features like auto-completion and syntax highlighting, while customizing their maintenance systems for different equipment and regulations. Extra features include Android Emulation, PDF/Word Export and Bluetooth Export. </p>

								<h3>iPhone Music Player App</h3>
								<p>I recently attended a free iOS Development Workshop hosted by Lighthouse Labs. I was introduced to XCode and the basics of Storyboarding a mobile application and the structure of what an app would look like. Although there wasn't a lot of coding involved, I managed to create this simple prototype music player application. I love that XCode has "Views" with UI controls that can be easily added and look forward to learning more about iOS Applications! </p>

								<h3>Traveler</h3>
								<p>I recently completed a Co-Op term with Deloitte China in their Hong Kong offices for 4 months.

I am also proficient with Cantonese and Mandarin, two of the fastest growing languages in Vancouver. </p>
